# Dependency Watch

Script to wait for an artifact to appear on Maven Central or to monitor coordinates for new
versions.

Just release a new artifact and want to know when you can start using it?
```
$ dependency-watch await com.example:example:1.1.0 && say "Example 1.1.0 is available!"
```

Pipe to a notification, email, HTTP request, sound, or anything else your heart desires.

### Monitor

The `notify` subcommand allows you to monitor multiple groupId/artifactId coordinates at once.

Create a `config.yaml` with a coordinate list.
```yaml
coordinates:
 - com.example:example
 - com.jakewharton:dependency-watch
```

Pass the config file and a `--data` directory to store already-seen versions:
```
$ dependency-watch notify --data data config.yaml
```

This will check for any new versions once and then exist. Run with `--watch` to continuously check
every minute. Use `--interval` to adjust the check period.

### IFTTT

Both the `await` and `notify` subcommands print new versions to the console. The `--ifttt` option
accepts an [IFTTT webhook URL](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) to notify when a new version is
found. This notification can then be redirected to Twitter, Slack, email, printers,
light bulbs, and hundreds of other places.

The event will have the following data set:
 - `Value1`: The groupId:artifactId pair (e.g., `com.example:example`)
 - `Value2`: The new versions that was seen (e.g., `1.1.0`)
 - `Value3`: Not used


## Install

**Mac OS**

```
$ brew install JakeWharton/repo/dependency-watch
```

**Other**

Download ZIP from [latest release](https://github.com/JakeWharton/dependency-watch/releases/latest) and
run `bin/dependency-watch` or `bin/dependency-watch.bat`.


## Docker

The container runs the tool using cron on a specified schedule and will notify IFTTT.

[![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/jakewharton/dependency-watch?sort=semver)][hub]
[![Docker Image Size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/jakewharton/dependency-watch)][layers]

 [hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jakewharton/dependency-watch/
 [layers]: https://microbadger.com/images/jakewharton/dependency-watch

```
$ docker run -it --rm
    -v /path/to/config:/config \
    -v /path/to/data:/data \
    -e "CRON=0 * * * *" \
    -e "NOTIFY_IFTTT=..." \
    jakewharton/dependency-watch:trunk
```

To be notified when sync is failing visit https://healthchecks.io, create a check, and specify
the ID to the container using the `HEALTHCHECK_ID` environment variable.

### Docker Compose
